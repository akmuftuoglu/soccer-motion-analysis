# soccer-motion-analysis

In this experiment, we analyzed the motion of the leg that kicks a soccer ball. Ultimately, we found that the experimental data aligned with our hypothesis and pre-existing scientific knowledge of natural phenomena. We found that there is a 0.9614 m/s increase in ball velocity for every 1 m/s^2 increase in maximum leg acceleration of the kicking leg and a 0.5857 m/s increase in ball velocity for every 1 m/s increase in maximum leg velocity of the kicking leg.
